# Brave Combat Simulator


## What is this?
This is an isolated simulator for [Brave](https://brave-game.com) that anyone can use to tinker with a simulated combat loop. 

## How do I run it?
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jasonmcleod/brave-combat-simulator
$ cd brave-combat-simulator
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

## Okay, why would I want to run it?
Game balance is hard as hell. I wrote this thing to help me test different formulas. I'm hoping someone else is better at this than I am, and wants to mess around with these formulas to help balance Brave. 


## You formulas
Check out the getters in `Character.ts`
